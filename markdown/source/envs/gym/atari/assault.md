The player is presented with an alien mother ship, which continually deploys three smaller ships during play.[2] The mother ship and the smaller vessels shoot at a weapon the player is in command of, and the player's aim is to eliminate the opposition while preventing the weapon from receiving enough fire to destroy it.[2] The player uses a joystick to operate the game, and only one player at a time can play.[1]
